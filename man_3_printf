Upon successful return, _printf() will return the number of characters printed excluding the null byte presented at the end. If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIER
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifier and their meanings are:

.TP
\fBd\fR, \fBi\fR
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear.

.TP
\fBc\fR
If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP

\fBs\fR
If no l modifier is present: The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
